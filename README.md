# nodejs-react-bookstore-capstone

A Fullstack Bookstore app for Employees

Building a Full-Stack Application to Explore the Offerings in a Simple Bookstore

Capstone Overview

In this capstone, you will create a full-stack application that allows bookstore employees to internally manage the books carried by a small bookstore.

You will begin by designing and implementing a back-end system for the bookstore. This will involve creating a relational database to store information about books, authors, and genres, and building a REST API to interact with the database.

NOTE: This application will NOT include any ability to purchase books.
You will also design a front-end application that allows users to make queries about books that are carried, as well as add/delete/edit data.

Part 1: Building the Node.js Back-end

---

Database Requirements

Create a MySQL database for your bookstore with the following requirements:

Books Table:

book_id (Primary Key)
title (VARCHAR)
author_id (Foreign Key referencing the Authors table)
genre_id (Foreign Key referencing the Genres table)
price (DECIMAL)
publication_date (DATE)

Authors Table:

author_id (Primary Key)
name (VARCHAR)
biography (TEXT)

Genres Table:

genre_id (Primary Key)
genre_name (VARCHAR)
Create a script to clear all data in all tables and then seed the tables with sample data to support API testing.

REST API Requirements

Create your API server and the following endpoints:

Books:

GET /books : Retrieve a list of all books
GET /books/{book_id} : Retrieve details of a specific book
POST /books : Add a new book
PUT /books/{book_id} : Update details of an existing book
DELETE /books/{book_id} : Delete a specific book

Authors:

GET /authors : Retrieve a list of all authors
GET /authors/{author_id} : Retrieve details of a specific author
POST /authors : Add a new author
PUT /authors/{author_id} : Update details of an existing author
DELETE /authors/{author_id} : Delete a specific author

Genres:

GET /genres : Retrieve a list of all genres
GET /genres/{genre_id} : Retrieve details of a specific genre
POST /genres : Add a new genre

API considerations:

Implement error handling for scenarios such as invalid input, non-existent records, and database connectivity issues.
Ensure data validation for all inputs to the API to maintain data integrity.

Back-end Repository Requirements

Provide a Git repository in either GitHub or GitLab

Include in your repo's README file instructions on how to set up and run your project, including:

how to create the database and inserting sample data
how to run the server
list of endpoints

Your repo should also include:
SQL scripts for creating the database and inserting sample data
source code for the REST API

Part 2: Building a Front-end

---

Front-end Requirements
Create a React front-end application that interacts with the REST API you built in Part 1. The application should include the following features:

Home Page:
Display a welcome message and a brief description of the bookstore application

Books Page:
Display a list of all books retrieved from the /books endpoint
Allow users to view details of a specific book by clicking on a book title, which fetches data from the /books/{book_id} endpoint
Provide a form to add a new book, making a POST request to the /books endpoint
Enable editing of book details through a form that sends a PUT request to the /books/{book_id} endpoint
Allow deletion of a book with a button that sends a DELETE request to the /books/{book_id} endpoint

Authors Page:
Display a list of all authors retrieved from the /authors endpoint
Allow users to view details of a specific author by clicking on an authorâ€™s name, which fetches data from the /authors/{author_id} endpoint
Provide a form to add a new author, making a POST request to the /authors endpoint
Enable editing of author details through a form that sends a PUT request to the /authors/{author_id} endpoint
Allow deletion of an author with a button that sends a DELETE request to the /authors/{author_id} endpoint

General Considerations:
Ensure the front-end application has proper error handling for failed API requests and invalid inputs
Implement loading indicators for data-fetching operations
Include basic styling to make the application user-friendly and visually appealing

Front-end Repository Requirements
Provide a Git repository in either GitHub or GitLab

Include in your repo's README file:
an overview of the project
instructions on how to set up and run your web application
sample screen shots of interesting features

------------------------INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROJECT SETUP---------------------
open the project folder in vs code
In the terminal, navigate to the server folder using cd command and then run command "npm start"

Message shown in console will be "Connection has been established successfully." and port number will be 5000

open another terminal and navigate to client folder and run command "npm start"
